# ðŸ§¬ GeneHack AMR

**GeneHack AMR** is a machine learning-powered tool designed to predict **antimicrobial resistance (AMR)** from genomic or clinical data. Built to support researchers, healthcare professionals, and bioinformatics experts, this tool leverages trained ML models to assist in identifying resistant microbial strains quickly and accurately.

## ðŸš€ Project Motivation

Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most critical challenges in global health today. Rapid and reliable prediction of AMR can:
- Improve treatment decisions
- Reduce misuse of antibiotics
- Help contain the spread of resistant infections

**GeneHack AMR** was created during **Docathon** to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied for impactful bioinformatics solutions.
